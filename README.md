    <td>A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is a palindrome, as can be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and observing that they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the characters in the string and then compare with them the original-in a palindrome, the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with functions- 
a) To print original string followed by reversed string using stack 
b) To check whether given string is palindrome or not
